## Overview
This application shows resulted sinogram and image reconstruction calculated from input image using computed tomography algorithm. The algorithm used are [Filtered Back Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomographic_reconstruction) and [SART (Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_algebraic_reconstruction_technique).
